# Simple As Possible Computer (SAP)

_WORK IN PROGRESS_

This project implements a loose interpretation of [Malvino and Brown's
SAP-1 computer
architecture](http://deeprajbhujel.blogspot.com/2015/12/sap-1-architecture.html)
(as first described in [Digital Computer Electronics
(1977)](https://books.google.com/books/about/Digital_Computer_Electronics.html?id=mUWN0aIIqzkC)).
The end goal is to replicate [Ben Eater's TTL
Computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyznrdDSSGM&list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU).
Ben made a fascinating series of Youtube videos where he builds and
extends the SAP-1 architecture, using nothing but simple 74xx
transistors, on breadboard. For my CPU, instead of hand wiring logic
chips, the entire design is defined in software, as Verilog code. This
code can be simulated on a workstation, and proven to operate the way
it is intended. Eventually, this software could be turned into real
hardware on an FPGA board.

This code runs with the [Icarus Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/)
open source simulation tool on a regular Linux PC. Each component of
the system is written and tested in isolation. Each unit is its own
separate directory, with its own Makefile to run a Python test suite,
written with [cocotb](https://github.com/potentialventures/cocotb).
Adhering to this structure means that every unit is fully modular, and
easier to comprehend and test, by drawing a box around it.

Synthesis is not yet supported. I don't own an FPGA development board
yet, but I plan to check out
[IceStorm](http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/), a fully open source
toolchain, once I do. (I hope I haven't written any non-synthesizable
verilog yet! FPGAs only work with a _subset_ of the Verilog language.)
:/

This same project has been implemented several times, in different
ways, by many people:
 * [JetStarBlues/BenEater_CPU](https://github.com/JetStarBlues/BenEater_CPU)
 * [ellisgl/sap-1-v2-mojo](https://github.com/ellisgl/sap-1-v2-mojo)
 * [Vdragon/SAP_1](https://github.com/Vdragon/Vdragon_s_Verilog_modules/tree/master/SAP_1)
 * [joshcorbin/sap-1-complete](http://joshcorbin.com/sap-1-complete/)

Writing your own version of SAP-1, from scratch, is a worthwhile
project. It can be a very elucidating process, whether it materializes
as physical logic chips, on a breadboard, as Hardware Description
Language, running in a virtual machine... or in any abstraction, not
yet realized. (Could reality itself be composed of sucessive lambda
calculus expressions? [a(b)=1; a(1)=a(a(b))=2;
a(6)=a(a(a(a(a(a(b))))))=7; find b;]) Actually going down the path,
and doing the work yourself, shows you what you did not know before:
there is an understanding of how a thing works, and there is a
knowledge of how a thing works. These are not the same thing.

## The SAP-1

SAP-1 is a simple 8-bit computer architecture with only 128 _bits_ of
memory (16 bytes!), 2 program registers, and 5 instructions. A
*really* simple computer. Here's a comparison with a few other 8 bit
computers:

The two straight lines, going down the middle, represent a shared bus
between components, which is 8 bits wide. The bus can transmit
arbitrary binary data, as well as program instructions. In many other
CPU designs, there are two busses: one for instructions/addresses, and
a separate one for data. The two bus architecture is often called
Harvard design. The SPA-1 design is supposed to be simpler, so both
data, and instructions, share a single bus, like a time-share.

When the bus is used for binary data, all 8 bits of the bus are used.
It's just data. 

When the bus is used for instructions, the 8 bits are split in half:
using the first/left 4 bits (called hiNib) as the Op Code (the 'what'
to do), and the second/right 4 bits (called loNib) as the Operand,
which usually specifies a memory address (the 'thing' to do 'what'
upon).

| Component | Name                     | Size / Type                                                    | Purpose                                                                                                            |

Since all the components share a single bus, there has to be something
that ensures that only one thing writes to the bus at a time. This
controller should say who should read from the bus, and who should
ignore it. The letters with arrows, represented in the diagram, show
lines coming from a central controller. The controller decodes the
instruction in the Instruction Register, and based on this input, the
Controller knows what components to talk to get the requested job
done, on time. It has dedicated wires, outside the bus, running to all
the various parts of the system and ensures things happen in the right
order.

## Instruction set

The original SAP-1 has only 5 instructions:

| Instruction | Op code (hiNib) | Operand (loNib)                  | Description                                                    |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| LDA         | 0000            | 4 bit memory address to load     | Load memory at the given address into the accumulator register |
| ADD         | 0001            | 4 bit memory address to add      | Add memory at the given address to the accumulator register    |
| SUB         | 0010            | 4 bit memory address to subtract | Subtract memory at address from accumulator register           |
| OUT         | 1110            | None                             | Send accumulator contents to the output register               |
| HLT         | 1111            | None                             | Halt program                                                   |

The computer is deterministically controlled by the contents of its
RAM. If the RAM contents is changed, then the process of the computer
is changed. Conversely, if the same RAM contents are used multiple
times, the same process is performed every time. Therefore, if you
want the computer to do something, you program the RAM, and the
computer will do what is in the RAM.

The user of SAP-1 is expected to program the RAM before the computer
starts execution. The machine has two modes: program mode, and
execution mode. In program mode, the RAM is disconnected from the bus,
and the user can directly edit the contents of the RAM through input
switches. Both program and data must be input. In execution mode,
these switches are disconnected, and the RAM is connected to the main
bus instead. The RAM provides the program and data for the rest of the
computer to follow and use.

## Example program execution

Here is an example snapshot of the contents of the RAM. The program
containing the instructions always starts at memory address 0000, and
continues until an HLT instruction is found. In this example, the
program is in memory locations 0000 through 0101. Addresses after HLT
is where data storage starts, locations 0110 through 1111, and can
contain data to be used during the execution of the program, using any
of the LDA, ADD, or SUB instructions.

| Memory Address | Memory Contents (hiNib loNib) | Decoded Instruction | Description                                                                                                    |

Once the user has programmed all of this data into RAM, the computer
is switched to execution mode. The Program Counter (PC) counts from
0000 to 1111 (or until HLT), which advances through all the memory
addresses, one by one. Starting at memory address 0000, the first
instruction is read, and then executed (LDA 9). The Program Counter
advances to 0001, and the second memory address is read (ADD E), and
then executed, and so on. Once memory address 5 (0101) is read, an HLT
instruction is parsed, and execution stops.

 * The computer program calculates : 16 + 127 - 64
 * Then outputs: 79
 * Then calculates 79 + (-86), but does not display the answer.
 * Then stops.

## Is this really a computer though?

With only five instructions, the only things SPA-1 can do are: Read
memory; Add and Subtract 8 bit numbers; Show the result; and Stop.
This is a calculator, not a full computer. To make this system useful,
more instructions need to be created. (Up to 16 instructions can be
created, using 4bit op codes.) As Ben shows, in his video [Making a
computer Turing
complete](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqNDk_UJW4k), its only a
handful of additonal instructions that are necessary to make this a
universal Turing Machine <sup>(still only with 16B of memory)</sup>.
Ben uses a modified instruction set (note the opcode changes):

| Instruction | Op code (hiNib) | Operand (loNib)                    | Description                                                                                     |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NOP         | 0000            | None                               | No operation                                                                                    |
| LDA         | 0001            | 4 bit memory address to read       | Read the contents of the given memory address, store it in the A register.                      |
| ADD         | 0010            | 4 bit memory address to add        | Add the contents of the given memory address to the A register.                                 |
| SUB         | 0011            | 4 bit memory address to subtract   | Subtract the contents of the given memory address from the A register.                          |
| STA         | 0100            | 4 bit memory address to write      | Write the contents of the A register into the memory at the given address.                      |
| LDI         | 0101            | 4 bit number to give to A directly | Load Data Immediately into register A, given the operand number (0-15). No RAM read.            |
| JMP         | 0110            | 4 bit number to give to P. Counter | Jump. Set the Program Counter to the given operand, which will be the next instruction pointer. |
| JC          | 0111            | 4 bit number to give to P. Counter | Jump conditionally, on carry flag.                                                              |
| JZ          | 1000            | 4 bit number to give to P. Counter | Jump conditionally, on zero flag.                                                               |
| OUT         | 1110            | None                               | Send accumulator contents to the output register.                                               |
| HLT         | 1111            | None                               | Halt program.                                                                                   |

The addition of the ability to store data back to RAM, and the three
new jump instructions, provide the capabilities of a Turing Machine; a
computer that is capable of calculating any calculable problem
<sup>(within memory constraints)</sup>.

# Setup for development and simulation

```
# Install dependencies (I use Arch Linux):
pacman -S iverilog

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/EnigmaCurry/SAP.git
cd SAP

# Checkout cocotb submodule
git submodule init
git submodule update

# Each component has its own Makefile in its own directory.
# Running 'make' will simulate the component by itself, driven 
# by a Python test bench found in the same directory:
cd program_counter
make

# Integration tests are tests that invole two or more components
# interacting together at the same time. Find these tests in the
# integration/test directory:
cd ../integration/test/pc_and_mar
make

# Eventually there will be a Makefile here in the root directory that
# wraps all the components together to form a single CPU module. For
# now, this is all just a bunch of individual parts.
```
